<h1 style="text-align: center;">Odd & Even Numbers 💻🖥️</h1>

# Introduction

<p> Hello students 👋 In this repository we will check if your assignment passed the requirement. </p>

## Requirements:

<p>List down 10 numbers and identify which are odd and which are even.</p>

<i>Expeceted Outcome</i>

```bash
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
```

## Steps:

### 1. First we need to create a js file named "odd_even_lesson2".

### 2. List 10 Numbers Using the For Loop.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

### 3. Create a Conditional Statement to Identify Even Numbers.

```javascript
...
if (i % 2 == 0) {
  console.log(`${i} is even`);
}
...
```

### 4. Create a Conditional Statement to Identify Even Numbers.

```javascript
...
else{
  console.log(`${i} is odd`);
}
...
```
